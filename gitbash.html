<h2>gitbash structure</h2>

    <h2>Repository</h2>
            <h3>The overall package or project. There is typically a remote of origin respository,

            <h3>An extension of a repository. All repositories, or repos,start with a 'master' branch. 
                From there, new branches can be created and used for new features. The idea is to keep the master
                 branch clean and working for the final " done" project.</h3>

        <h2>Commit</h2>

            <h3>a commit is a change to the repository. 
                For every commit made, there is a recod of the state of 
                the repository at that given point in time.</h3>
